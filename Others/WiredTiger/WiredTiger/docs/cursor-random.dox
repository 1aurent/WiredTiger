/*! @m_page{{c,java},cursor_random,Cursor random}

The \c next_random configuration to the WT_SESSION::open_cursor method
configures the cursor to return a pseudo-random record from a row-store
object.

The ability to return a random record was added to support a particular
application, and as a result has somewhat unusual semantics.  First, the
returned record may not be random at all in the case of objects with only a few
rows (especially when the object has never been written to the backing store).
In such objects, the WT_CURSOR::next method for cursors configured with \c
next_random may return the same row on each call.  Additionally, even in larger
objects, the WT_CURSOR::next method usually returns the first record from a
random page in the underlying file, not a random record from a random page.
